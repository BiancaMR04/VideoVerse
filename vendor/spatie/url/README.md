# Parse, build and manipulate URLs

A simple package to deal with URLs in your applications.

Retrieve parts of the URL:

```php
use Spatie\Url\Url;

$url = Url::fromString('https://spatie.be/opensource');

echo $url->getScheme(); // 'https'
echo $url->getHost(); // 'spatie.be'
echo $url->getPath(); // '/opensource'
```

Transform any part of the URL (the `Url` class is immutable):

```php
$url = Url::fromString('https://spatie.be/opensource');

echo $url->withHost('github.com')->withPath('spatie');
// 'https://github.com/spatie'
```

Retrieve and transform query parameters:

```php
$url = Url::fromString('https://spatie.be/opensource?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=packages');

echo $url->getQuery(); // 'utm_source=github&utm_campaign=packages'

echo $url->getQueryParameter('utm_source'); // 'github'
echo $url->getQueryParameter('utm_medium'); // null
echo $url->getQueryParameter('utm_medium', 'social'); // 'social'
echo $url->getQueryParameter('utm_medium', function() {
    //some logic
    return 'email';
}); // 'email'

echo $url->withoutQueryParameter('utm_campaign'); // 'https://spatie.be/opensource?utm_source=github'
echo $url->withQueryParameters(['utm_campaign' => 'packages']); // 'https://spatie.be/opensource?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=packages'
```

Retrieve path segments:

```php
$url = Url::fromString('https://spatie.be/opensource/laravel');

echo $url->getSegment(1); // 'opensource'
echo $url->getSegment(2); // 'laravel'
```

Implements PSR-7's `UriInterface` interface:

```php
class Url implements UriInterface { /* ... */ }
```

The [`league/uri`](https://github.com/thephpleague/uri) is a more powerful package than this one. The main reason this package exists, is because the alternatives requires non-standard php extensions. If you're dealing with special character encodings or need bulletproof validation, you're definitely better off using `league/uri`.
